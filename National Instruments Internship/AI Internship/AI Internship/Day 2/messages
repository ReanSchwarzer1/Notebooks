The easiest way to upload files to both Kaggle and Colab is to upload your file to Google Drive first. 

Then install this if you are using chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/curlwget/jmocjfidanebdlinpbcdkcmgdifblncg?hl=en

Or this if you are using Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cliget/

Then try to download the file you uploaded to drive. Now the system will ask you where to save. Click cancel and stop the download. Then click on the extension I have mentioned above. You will find a lengthy link(command) starting with 'wget'. Copy this link and paste it in Kaggle/Colab after adding ! before the lengthy link(command). Now the file will be downloaded into whatever notebook you are working with
